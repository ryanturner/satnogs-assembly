This assembly guide is for the Satnogs Rotator v3.0. While the photos are of the imperially sized version, the guide steps are applicable for both. 

# Bottom Azimuth Picture Frame
* Needed Parts:
    *  2x **2020 T-Slot Extrusion, 160 mm long**
    *  2x **2020 T-Slot Extrusion, 102 mm long**
    *  Either:
        * 4x **2020 Corner Brace Support**, 8x **M5-8mm bolt**, and 10x **M5 2020 T-Nut**
        * 6x **2020 Inside Hidden Corner Bracket**
* Assembly Steps:
    1. If using the **Corner Brace Support**, put a **bolt** and **T-Nut** through each hole
    2. Slide the corner piece over the **102 mm** extrusion on its top and bottom along the same side, with the flat sides facing out; tighten the bolt in order to fix the bracket flush against the edge of the extrusion
    3. Place the a **t-nut** or **hidden corner bracket** on the side immediately to the right of the brackets on one extrusion and to the left of the brackets on the other with the same orientation
    2. Slide the two **102 mm** extrusion pieces into the **160 mm** extrusions
* Result:
    A picture-frame shape with either t-nuts or hidden corners in each short extrusion on the top face

# Azimuth Sides
* Needed Parts:
    *  5x **2020 T-Slot Extrusion, 102 mm long**
    *  Either:
        * 5x **2020 Corner Brace Support**, 8x **M5-8mm bolt**, and 8x **M5 2020 T-Nut**
        * 3x **2020 Inside Hidden Corner Bracket**
* Assembly Steps:
    1. If using the **Corner Brace Support**, put a **bolt** and **T-Nut** one hole on each **support** and slide it through the extrusion; then, on three of the pieces, place a **bolt** and **t-nut** through the additional hole
    2. If using the **Hidden Corner Bracket**, 
* Result:
    Five **102 mm extrusion** pieces with either **hidden corner bracket** pieces in two or **corner brace support** pieces in each, three having **screw**s and **t-nut**s in the bottom

#  Worm Mount
* Needed Parts:
    * 1x 3D-Printed **worm_mount.stl**
    * 2x **M5-10mm bolt**
    * 2x **M5 2020 T-Nut**
* Assembly Steps:
    1. Place the **bolt**s through the two holes on the **worm_mount**s and attach the **t-nut**s, forming the **bottom worm mount assembly**
    2. With the bearing slot nearest the middle, slide the **bottom worm mount assembly** through the interior side of the two **upright extrusion**s that were inserted from the same end of the same side of the **picture frame**
    3. Position the **bottom worm mount assembly** parallel to the picture frame as low as possible, then tighten the **bolt**s
* Result:
    The **Azimuth Frame** with the **worm_mount** sitting on the short **extrusion**s, bearing side up on the two **upright extrusion**s that were inserted from the same end

#  Worm Mount
* Needed Parts:
    * 1x 3D-Printed **axis_side.stl**
    * 4x **M5-10mm bolt**
    * 4x **M5 2020 T-Nut**
* Assembly Steps:
    1. Place the **bolt**s through the four holes on the **axis_side**s on the recessed side and attach the **t-nut**s, forming the **axis side assembly**
    2. Slide the **axis side assembly** through the interior side of the two **upright extrusion**s on the left side of where the **bottom worm mount assembly** was placed
    3. Position the **axis side assembly** parallel to the picture frame as low as possible, then tighten the **bolt**s
* Result:
    The **Azimuth Frame** with the **axis_side** sitting on the short **extrusion**s, nut holders in, resting just above the **bottom worm mount**
